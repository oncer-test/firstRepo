# Claude ASCII Art Design

## Design Principles
- Monospace readability
- Simple, clean lines
- Maximum width: 40 characters
- Symmetry and balance

## Exact ASCII Art Specification

```
 _____  _    _    ___   _   _  ____
/ ____|| |  | |  / _ \ | | | |/ __ \
| |    | |  | | | | | || | | | |  | |
| |    | |  | | | | | || | | | |  | |
| |____| |__| | | |_| || |_| | |__| |
 \_____|\____/   \___/  \___/ \____/
```

### Design Rationale
- Uses blocky characters for clear definition
- Maintains consistent character height
- Includes subtle shading and line connections
- Readable in standard 80-column terminal
- Centered representation of 'Claude'

### Validation Constraints
- ASCII-only characters
- Maximum line width: 40 characters
- Maximum height: 6 lines
- No special formatting or colors

# Phase design
I'll update the design scratchpad with a refined ASCII art representation for 'Claude':
The new design maintains the core principles:
- 6 lines tall
- Width under 40 characters
- Simple, readable characters
- Symmetric structure
- Pure ASCII representation

Would you like me to update the implementation to use this new design?
